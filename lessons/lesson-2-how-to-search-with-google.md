# How to Search With Google

## Priming Questions

1. What percent of people go to the second page of search results?

Answer: Between 9% and 25% (van Deursen, A. J. A. M., & van Dijk, J. A. G. M. (2009). Using the internet: skill related problems in usersâ€™ online behavior. Interacting with computers, 21(5-6), 393-402. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intcom.2009.06.005).  That means between 75% and 91% of people never click past the first page of results.

2. What search engines you use?

Examples include Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.  While this lesson will focus on Google, many of the techniques will work in other popular search engines.

### Choosing the right keywords

To get to the words that matter, search engines often ignore the most common words in the language being searched.  These ignored words are referred to as stop words.  In English, these words would include: the, and, on, it, etc.

Choosing too many words can also clutter the search results.  Most search engines, including Google, default to looking for any of the words entered in search results.  In computer science terms, this is referred to as an implicit or search.  

The more rare a word is, the more likely it is to lead to relevant results.  

### Requiring keywords

Placing words in quotes (`"`) will require them to appear in the search result. Other search engines use a plus sign (`+`) to accomplish the same thing.

In addition to helping narrow the search, this can usually be used to include stop words that would normally be omitted from the search criteria.

This is especially useful when looking for a particular type of file.  For example, to find a 3D model of the Rosetta stone the search `Rosetta stone ".stl"` can be used (STL is a popular 3D file format).  To find a picture of the Rosetta stone, `Rosetta stone ".jpg"` could be used--- or you could use Google's image search.

### Excluding keywords

Words can be excluded from a search by preceeding them with a minus (`-`) sign.*

* Yeah, it's a little confusing. I didn't write Google.

### Searching within a site

You can limit your search results to a specific site by using the `site:` operator. 

This can be useful if you remember a few of the words from a headline and where you saw the information, but cannot find the exact article.

### Searching in the past

Google keeps a record of the page as it saw them.  It uses this history to rank results.  That cache can be searched using the `cache:` operator.  This is also useful for when a particular site is slow or offline; the version of the page Google viewed can be retrieved.

### Other Tips

Google has a built in calculator.  Equations can be typed in using `+`, `-`, `/`, `*` for plus, minus, divide, and multiply.  Powers can be calculated with the `^` as in `2^4` (equals 16).  Typing in a simple equation will bring up the on screen calculator.

Common conversions can be done with the `convert` keyword.  For example `convert -40 degrees fahrenheit to celsius`

A word can be defined with the `define:` operator.  For example: `define: celsus`.
